# Habit Tracker Project Rules

## TypeScript & Component Guidelines

- **TypeScript Required**: All code must be written in TypeScript with proper type definitions
- **Small, Focused Components**: Create small, single-responsibility components
  - Each component should have a clear, focused purpose
  - Prefer composition over large monolithic components
  - Keep components under 200 lines when possible
- **Type Safety**: Define interfaces for all data structures (Habit, AppState, etc.)
- **No `any` Types**: Avoid using `any` - use proper types or `unknown` when necessary

## Planning & Scope

- **Follow @anti-pitfall-guidelines**: Always reference and follow the anti-pitfall planning guidelines when creating plans or making architectural decisions
- **MVP Scope**: Keep all work within the MVP scope defined in @.cursor/plans/habit-tracker-mvp.md
  - Do not add features outside the MVP scope (edit/delete habits, historical views, etc.)
  - Focus on core habit-tracking loop: add, track, streak display
  - If suggesting features beyond MVP, clearly mark them as "out of scope" or "future enhancement"

## Development Principles

- **Dependency Awareness**: Identify and sequence dependent tasks clearly
- **Iterative Milestones**: Complete milestones fully before moving to the next
- **Avoid Over-Engineering**: Start with happy path, add edge cases incrementally
- **Clear Scope**: Separate must-haves from nice-to-haves explicitly

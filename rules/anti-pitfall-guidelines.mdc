# Anti-Pitfall Planning Guidelines

When creating plans, follow these principles:

1. **MVP First**: Focus on core functionality before adding features

2. **Dependency Awareness**: Identify and sequence dependent tasks clearly

3. **Iterative Milestones**: Break work into independently valuable chunks

4. **Avoid Over-Engineering**: Start with the happy path, add edge cases later

5. **Clear Scope**: Separate must-haves from nice-to-haves explicitly
